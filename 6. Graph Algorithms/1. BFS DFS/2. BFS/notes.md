* No need to check "explored" when BFS applied on trees.
* Level wise BFS. See Leetcode 559, 104 etc
* Ways to do BFS- (learnt by solving problems, looking at good solutions, thinking)
  * Level wise. (Leetcode)
  * Explicit neighbour wise. ./bfs_1.py
* ToDo-
  * Practice "shortest path by bfs problem"
  * Practice "connected components of UG via BFS and DFS"
