### Notes
* in_order_traversal- 3 ways
  * recursive (1)
  * iterative and stack (2)
  * iterative and 2 pointers (morris traversal) (3)
* pre order traversal
  * recursive (simple modification of 1)
  * iterative and stack (simple modification of 2)
  * iterative and 2 pointers (morris traversal) (simple modification of 3)
* post_order_traversal
  * recursive (simple modification of 1)
  * iterative and 2 stacks
  * iterative and 1 stack
  * morris?
* calling in_order_traversal prints BST in sorted order (O(n) time.)
  * We spent O(nlogn) time to build the tree
* Morris pre/inorder- O(1) space, O(n) time

### Code üêç
* [Traversals](https://github.com/rohinarora/Algorithms/blob/master/Trees/Binary%20Search%20Trees/CLRS_Ch12/BST_traveral.py)

### To Do
* breadth first traversal
