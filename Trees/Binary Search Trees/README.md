### Notes
* in_order_traversal- 3 ways
  * recursive (1)
  * iterative and stack (2)
  * iterative and 2 pointers (morris traversal) (3)
* pre order traversal
  * recursive (simple modification of 1)
  * iterative and stack (simple modification of 2)
  * iterative and 2 pointers (morris traversal) (simple modification of 3)
* post_order_traversal
  * recursive (simple modification of 1)
  * iterative and 1 stack (some modification of 2)
  * iterative and 2 stacks
  * morris?
* calling in_order_traversal prints BST in sorted order (O(n) time.)
  * We spent O(nlogn) time to build the tree
* Morris pre/inorder- O(1) space, O(n) time
  * Idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree.
* Tree search
  * recursive
  * iterative
* Tree Min, Tree Max
* Successor, Predecessor
  * refer pred_succ_bst.md
* Tree insert
  * trailing pointer
* Tree delete (and Transplant)
  * refer delete.md
