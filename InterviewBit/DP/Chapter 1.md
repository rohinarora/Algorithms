Exercise 1.1: Self-Play.  Suppose, instead of playing against a random opponent, the reinforcement learning algorithm described above played against itself, with both sides learning. What do you think would happen in this case? Would it learn a different policy for selecting moves?

It might learn to intentionally make a bad move acting as an opponent, hence not learning optimal play
