Variation of "Longest Repeating Subsequence" (LRS). LRS is variation of longest common subsequence (LCS). LCS DP taken O(n^2) time.

This repeating sub sequence can be done in non DP way by O(n) time. The following solution is non DP O(n) time


Repeated subsequence exists for a palindrome string if it is of odd length and its middle letter is same as left(or right) character

1. Is sol1.py coded optimally? Can i do better?
